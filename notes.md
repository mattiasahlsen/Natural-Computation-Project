# Notes

## Data
96 * 96 input nodes
30 outputs (15 keypoints, x and y values)
### Questions
How many inner layers?
Where to run it?
Will it take long time to train?



## Todo
Research CNN network architecture for face recognition
Look up the [kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/face-images-with-marked-landmark-points/kernels) (read up, look at the configuration, loss function?)
Get a working pipeline
Augment the data appropriately
Have a probability to agument in different ways (in the pipeline somehow)
Look up Img-aug library
Look up Google collab
